# MetOcean Analysis
The so-called met-ocean study (or analysis) refers to the long-term analysis of the hydrological data (i.e. waves, wind, levels, current, etc.) time series. the climate (or regime) analysis aims at characterizing (in a statistical sense) the "mean" wave conditions that have been observed on a certain sea area in terms of magnitude, frequency, and direction. The starting dataset to be used for that analysis is made up of the significant wave height Hs time series. This time series can be made up of measured (e.g. by means of a wave buoy) or hindcasted (e.g. by means of the SMB method) wave data.
